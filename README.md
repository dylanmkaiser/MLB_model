What Question are You Answering:

Given home and away team season and  starting pitcher stats, who will win today's baseball games?

How are you going to do that:
1) Scrape historic baseball game preview stats
2) Scrape historic game results
3) Store scrape data in a database and link preview data to results data.
4) Train machine learning model to predict home team wins and losses based on preview stats
5) Build web page that pulls down daily baseball game preview data (same scrape as step 1)
6) Run model with daily preview data to predict winners.
